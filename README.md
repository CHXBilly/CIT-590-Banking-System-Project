# CIT-590-Banking-System-Project

This program will involve implementing a bank program that manages bank accounts and 
allows for deposits, withdrawals, purchases, sorting bank accounts based on different criteria, 
and exporting bank statements.
It will initially load a list of accounts from a .txt file, and deposits and withdrawals 
from additional .csv files. Then it will parse and combine all of the data and store it in a 
dictionary
